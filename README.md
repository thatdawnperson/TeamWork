# TeamWork
results of team-based work in the community

Not all of my development work necessarily involves code, and some of it happens as part of a team.
As a seasoned leader, I usually take a facilitating role: building and maintaining a safe space where
ideas can be shared and problems explored, keeping communication among the team transparent and mutually
respectful, ensuring everyone participates, encouraging the exploration of promising directions through
the "diamond shaped innovation" pattern of repeated divergence and convergence. I contribute to the meat
of the work as well, where my knowledge and skills are useful.

This repo contains the results (and may at times include intermediate work) of groups I have been or am
currently solving provlems with. All contents are by mutual consent freely shareable.

I helped build these things. They would not have their current shape without me. I could not have accomplished
these results on my own.
